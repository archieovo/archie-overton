            <p>
                At 14, building my first computer opened my eyes to the incredible potential of technology—not just as a hobby, but as a tool to help solve real challenges. What started as curiosity about how hardware and software work together quickly evolved into a passion for creating solutions that could genuinely benefit others. Through learning Python and building my first database-driven application, I discovered that I could turn ideas into working tools that make tasks easier and more efficient. Now, as I explore web development with React and dive into cybersecurity principles, I'm driven by a clear vision: to use my growing technical skills to build secure, user-friendly systems that protect people's data and improve their digital experiences. I believe that technology's greatest power lies in its ability to serve and safeguard communities, and I'm excited to contribute to that mission.
