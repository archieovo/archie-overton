            <p>
                My interest in technology began at age 14 when I built my first computer, sparking a fascination with how hardware and software interact. This curiosity quickly expanded into programming, starting with Python, where I experimented with basic programs and eventually developed my first major project involving databases and a fully functional Python application. While hardware introduced me to technology, it was the depth and creativity of software development that truly captivated me. Since then, I have continued to explore areas such as web development using React and the fundamentals of cybersecurity, continuously building both my practical skills and theoretical understanding.
