      'I took part in a work experience day at Experian, where I was introduced to how data is used to support business decisions. As part of the experience, I participated in a data analysis activity that involved sorting and interpreting a dataset to determine how different customer groups should receive differently priced Alton Towers ticket offers. This exercise helped me understand how companies use data-driven reasoning, segmentation, and teamwork to guide commercial decisions.',
      'We were also given a tour of Experian\'s Nottingham office, where I gained an understanding of how different departments collaborate within a large technology organisation. One of the most valuable parts of the day was speaking with current degree apprentices about their application processes, the skills they developed, and what it\'s like working at Experian. Their advice gave me a clearer idea of the expectations of apprenticeship roles and motivated me to continue building my skills in technology and cybersecurity.'
