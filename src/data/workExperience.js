      'At Experian, I discovered how data can be a powerful force for good—helping businesses make fair, informed decisions that ultimately serve customers better. During a hands-on data analysis exercise, I worked with my team to segment customer groups and design appropriately priced Alton Towers ticket offers. This experience showed me how thoughtful data analysis can create value for both businesses and consumers, ensuring people get access to opportunities that genuinely suit their needs.',
      'Touring Experian\'s Nottingham office and meeting degree apprentices was incredibly inspiring. Hearing their stories about growth, learning, and making real contributions to important projects reinforced my belief that I can make a meaningful impact in this field. Their journeys showed me that with dedication and the right opportunity, I can help build systems that protect people\'s financial data and empower them to make better decisions. This experience strengthened my commitment to pursuing a career where I can use technology to create positive, lasting change.'

      'During a five-day work experience placement at MHR Global in Ruddington, I spent three days with the Cyber Security team and two days with Software Engineering, gaining first-hand insight into how enterprise technology teams operate in a professional environment. ',
      'In Cyber Security, I conducted an OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) investigation on the organisation itself, analysing publicly available information to identify potential areas of risk and digital exposure, which I compiled into a structured report and presented to members of the cyber team — strengthening my analytical thinking, attention to detail, and ability to communicate technical findings clearly.',
      'In Software Engineering, I designed and developed a Python-based to-do list application, implementing core functionality and applying unit testing principles to validate program behaviour and data handling, before documenting the technologies used and testing methodology in a technical report.',
      'I also shadowed engineers to observe development workflows, testing processes, and team collaboration in practice.',
      'Overall, this experience reinforced my passion for cyber security and software development, while enhancing my problem-solving, technical communication, and understanding of industry-standard practices within a professional technology environment.',
